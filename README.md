## Pascal's Triangle
Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is constructed by starting with a row containing a single number 1, and each subsequent row is created by adding the adjacent numbers from the previous row. Here's an example of Pascal's triangle:

```
        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
   ...
```

Each number in Pascal's triangle represents a binomial coefficient, indicating the number of ways to choose elements from a set. The triangle has many interesting properties and applications in mathematics, such as combinatorics, probability, and algebraic expansions.

## Python Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules for solving specific problems. Python, being a versatile programming language, provides a wide range of built-in algorithms and libraries for various tasks. Python algorithms can be categorized into different domains, such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

Here are a few examples of Python algorithms:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Python provides built-in sorting algorithms such as `sorted()` (which uses Timsort), `list.sort()` (which uses a variation of Quicksort), and `heapq` module (which provides functions for heap-based algorithms like heapsort).

- **Searching Algorithms**: Python offers searching algorithms like linear search and binary search. Binary search is particularly efficient for sorted lists.

- **Graph Algorithms**: Python has libraries like `networkx` and `igraph` that provide a wide range of graph algorithms, including shortest path algorithms (like Dijkstra's algorithm), minimum spanning tree algorithms (like Prim's algorithm), and more.

- **Dynamic Programming**: Python supports dynamic programming techniques, which are useful for solving optimization problems with overlapping subproblems. Popular dynamic programming problems include the knapsack problem, the Fibonacci sequence, and matrix chain multiplication.
