The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, where the goal is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. In other words, no two queens should be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm:

1. **Initialize**: Create an N x N chessboard represented as a 2D array, where each element represents the position of a queen (0 for empty, 1 for a queen).

2. **Backtracking Function**: Implement a recursive backtracking function that tries to place a queen in each row, one by one.

3. **Place Queen**: Start by placing a queen in the first row, and then recursively try to place queens in the subsequent rows.

4. **Check Validity**: Before placing a queen in a specific column, check if it is a valid placement by ensuring that no other queen is in the same row, column, or diagonal.

5. **Recursive Call**: If a valid placement is found, recursively call the backtracking function to place a queen in the next row. If no valid placement is found, backtrack by removing the queen from the current row and try a different column.

6. **Base Case**: The base case occurs when all N queens have been placed successfully. In this case, return the current state of the chessboard.

Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
def solve_n_queens(n):
    def is_safe(board, row, col):
        # Check this row on the left side
        for i in range(col):
            if board[row][i] == 1:
                return False

        # Check upper diagonal on the left side
        for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):
            if board[i][j] == 1:
                return False

        # Check lower diagonal on the left side
        for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):
            if board[i][j] == 1:
                return False

        return True

    def solve_n_queens_util(board, col):
        # Base case: If all queens are placed, return True
        if col == n:
            solutions.append([row[:] for row in board])
            return True

        # Place this queen in all rows one by one
        for i in range(n):
            if is_safe(board, i, col):
                board[i][col] = 1

                # Recur to place rest of the queens
                solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1)

                # If placing a queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution, remove the queen
                board[i][col] = 0

        # If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column, return False
        return False

    solutions = []
    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    solve_n_queens_util(board, 0)
    return solutions
```

This implementation uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem. The `is_safe` function checks if a queen can be placed in a specific position on the chessboard without attacking any other queens. The `solve_n_queens_util` function recursively places queens in each row, backtracking when a valid placement cannot be found.

The `solve_n_queens` function initializes the chessboard and calls the recursive function to find all valid solutions. The solutions are stored in the `solutions` list, which is returned at the end.

You can call the `solve_n_queens` function with the desired value of `n` to get all the valid solutions for the N-Queens problem.
